## Iterate
We look at the Canvas as work in progress and we are incredibly grateful for any feedback or advice you might have on how we can improve future versions (and a sincere thank you to everyone who has helped develop it so far).

* How can we make it more valuable and practical for community builders across the globe?
* What is working for you?
* What are we missing?
* What examples would be useful to include?
* What communities would make good case studies?
* What research - academic and otherwise - should we look at for further study?

Please feel free to get in touch and already in advance, thank you!
